Here's how to run a React project using Vite with npm:

1. Clone the Repository
First, clone the project repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/haquedot/meraj-courses.git

2. Navigate to the Project Directory
After cloning the repository, navigate to the project directory:

cd meraj-courses

3. Install Dependencies
Install the required dependencies using npm:

npm install

4. Start the Development Server
Once the dependencies are installed, start the development server:

npm run dev

Vite will start the development server and provide a local URL, typically http://localhost:5173, where you can view the project in your browser.
